## The 11 Voices (Nate's Signal List)

### Builders & Practitioners

**Simon Willison** — Blog, Newsletter, GitHub
British programmer, co-creator of Django. Coined "prompt injection." His blog is the single best source for technically-grounded, practical AI analysis. Over 1,394 posts tagged 'ai'. If you follow one person, make it him.

**Chip Huyen** — Website, O'Reilly author
Author of *AI Engineering* (2025), the most-read AI book on O'Reilly's platform. Bridges AI research and production systems. Her three-layer AI stack framework (application, model, infrastructure) is essential vocabulary.

**Claire Vo** — ChatPRD.ai, "How I AI" Podcast
CPO at LaunchDarkly. Shows live demos of AI workflows with real business impact. Demonstrates how non-engineers can leverage AI for major productivity gains. Particularly relevant if you're exploring how AI tools fit into professional workflows.

### Researchers & Technical Leaders

**Andrej Karpathy** — YouTube, eureka.ai
Former Tesla AI Director, OpenAI co-founder. His YouTube series are the gold standard for understanding AI technically without a CS degree. Coined "vibe coding." Start with his "Intro to Large Language Models" (1 hour).

**Ilya Sutskever** — SSI (Safe Superintelligence Inc.)
OpenAI co-founder, co-inventor of AlexNet. Left OpenAI to focus exclusively on safe superintelligence. His prediction that pre-training as we know it will end is reshaping research directions.

**Demis Hassabis** — Google DeepMind
Nobel Prize in Chemistry (2024) for AlphaFold. The only AI leader with Nobel-level scientific achievements. Conservative on AGI timelines (5-10 years), which makes his assessments more credible to many.

### CEOs Shaping the Field

**Sam Altman** — OpenAI
Direct access to frontier systems. His "gentle singularity" framework — radical change feels manageable when experienced incrementally — is a useful lens for enterprise AI planning.

**Dario Amodei** — Anthropic (makes Claude)
Most scientifically rigorous CEO perspective. His essay "Machines of Loving Grace" provides detailed, evidence-based predictions. Architect of Constitutional AI and scaling laws.

### Analysts & Educators

**Ethan Mollick** — Wharton, "One Useful Thing" Substack
Research-backed frameworks for AI adoption in work and education. 320K+ subscribers. His approach to AI in education provides great models for AI in knowledge management.

**Mary Meeker** — Bond Capital
Her 340-page AI Trends report (May 2025) is the most comprehensive data-driven analysis of AI's economic impact. Essential for business-level conversations about AI.

**Dwarkesh Patel** — Dwarkesh Podcast
24-year-old podcaster who has become essential listening for AI frontier understanding. Deeply researched interviews with Zuckerberg, Blair, Andreessen, and leading researchers.

## Learning Resources (Nate's Curated Path)

### Start Here (Week 1-2)
1. **Andrej Karpathy: "Intro to Large Language Models"** — 1-hour masterclass. The best LLM introduction for general audiences. No technical background required.

2. **3Blue1Brown: Neural Networks Series** — Visual masterpiece that makes neural network math intuitive. 7 chapters, ~3 hours total. Covers both classical networks and transformers.

### Go Deeper (Week 3-5)
3. **Stanford CS231n** (Karpathy's Stanford course) — 16 lectures on deep learning fundamentals. Free, self-paced. The gold standard for serious understanding.

4. **Andrej Karpathy: "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"** — 8 lectures building neural networks from scratch in Python. Culminates in building GPT from scratch. Hands-on and revelatory.

### Stay Current (Ongoing)
5. **Stanford CS25: Transformers United** — Weekly research talks from the people writing the landmark papers. Standalone 60-minute deep dives. Like office hours with the field's top authors.

6. **Claude Code DevDay** — Understanding agentic AI development. How AI goes from assisting line-by-line to taking ownership of entire features.

7. **Yannic Kilcher: Paper Explained** — When a breakthrough paper drops, Kilcher posts a 20-40 minute whiteboard walkthrough. The fastest route from research paper to real understanding.

## Additional Resources for KM-AI Intersection

These aren't from Nate's list but are specifically valuable for your positioning:

**Anthropic's Documentation** (docs.anthropic.com) — Understanding Claude specifically, including system prompts, tool use, and enterprise deployment.

**Simon Willison's LLM CLI tool** (GitHub) — A practical way to experiment with multiple AI models from the command line. Learning by doing.

**Ethan Mollick's "Co-Intelligence"** (book) — Practical frameworks for working alongside AI. Directly applicable to knowledge work.

**Chip Huyen's "AI Engineering"** (book, 2025) — The most current guide to building production AI systems. Useful even for non-engineers to understand the stack.

**Nate Jones' Substack** (natesnewsletter.substack.com) — Ongoing coverage of AI developments, explained accessibly. His A-to-Z cheat sheet is an excellent quick reference.

## A Practical Learning Strategy

You don't need to consume everything at once. Here's a realistic approach:

**This week:** Watch Karpathy's 1-hour intro. Follow 3-5 people from the list on your platform of choice.

**This month:** Work through the 3Blue1Brown series. Read 2-3 of the modules in this repository that feel weakest for you.

**Ongoing:** Subscribe to Nate's and Mollick's substacks. When a major AI announcement happens, check Simon Willison's blog for the most grounded analysis.

**For interviews:** Re-read Module 13 (KM-AI Connection) and Module 14 (Glossary) before any conversation. Have 2-3 specific examples ready that connect AI concepts to your experience.

## Key Takeaways

- Follow practitioners (Willison, Huyen, Vo) for practical signal, not just hype
- Karpathy's content is the single best educational resource for understanding AI technically
- Mollick's research provides frameworks for AI adoption in organizations
- A realistic learning plan: 1 hour this week, a few hours this month, ongoing subscriptions
- The glossary (Module 14) is your interview quick-reference
